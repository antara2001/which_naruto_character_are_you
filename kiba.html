            <p style="font-family: 'Permanent Marker', cursive;">Kiba is often short-tempered and impulsive and can make mistakes when he becomes agitated in battle. He also enjoys combat when facing a stronger opponent. He cares deeply for Akamaru and is willing to do whatever is necessary to protect him. Despite his gruff attitude, many of Kiba's actions reveal that he is very close to his friends. </p>
