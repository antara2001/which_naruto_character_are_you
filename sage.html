            <p style="font-family: 'Permanent Marker', cursive;"> Jiraiya was generally light-hearted and gregarious. In his interactions with others, he liked to pretend to be smug or selfish. Despite being an eccentric troublemaker in his youth, Jiraiya proved to be a competent Shinobi. Jiraiya was also capable of coming up with new strategies in the middle of battle based on his keen observations. </p>
