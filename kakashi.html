            <p style="font-family: 'Permanent Marker', cursive;"> Kakashi has a dynamic personality. At his younger age, he was a very serious ninja. He strictly followed orders and scorned anyone who disobeyed them. Now he has a more carefree and laid-back personality. He has a relaxed voice and minimalist attitude. Despite this, he cares deeply for the members of his team and his friends. </p>
