            <p style="font-family: 'Permanent Marker', cursive;">Choji is a very kind, polite, and caring person. These characteristics are his greatest strength, while his greatest weakness was his lack of self-confidence. He is easily motivated by the prospect of food. However, he does not hide his love for food. He is not "fatso" he is "pleasantly plump". </p>
