            <p style="font-family: 'Permanent Marker', cursive;"> Naruto is generally a very simple-minded, easy-going, cheerful person. He often rushes things and misses obvious things like Hinata's constant shyness around him. He is fun-loving, pulling pranks on fellow villagers. He has an impressive dedication to his friends, often willing to put his life on the line to protect them. </p>
